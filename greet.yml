msg : Sure! Here's a paragraph summarizing your Spring Cloud Config client setup:
The Spring Boot application named **"greet"** is configured to run on port **9090** and fetch its 
externalized configuration from a **Spring Cloud Config Server** running at `http://localhost:8080`.
This is achieved using the `spring.config.import` property with the `optional:configserver:` prefix, 
which ensures the application can still start even if the config server is temporarily unavailable. By specifying the 
application name as "greet", the config server will attempt to load properties from a corresponding file such as `greet.yml`
or `greet.properties` in the remote configuration repository. This setup centralizes configuration management, making it easier to
maintain consistency across multiple services.
